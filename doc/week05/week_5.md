   * Start creating a message list for our Bluetooth connection. 
   * Update UI to allow the user to select prefered security level during setup.
   * Implement continuous transmission of messages to Server

 **PAM:**
   * Create a secure channel between the Linux Pam (server side) & Android app (client side) and send challenge response 
   * Rewrite Makefile and PAM to be more modular (mainly to allow testing and sanitation testing easier to perform)
